           <h3>
            How does the virus spread?

           </h3>
           COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.
       </p>

           <h3>
            What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?
           </h3>
           Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. Babies younger than 1 and children with certain underlying medical conditions may be more likely to have serious illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).
            For more information about how people get sick with the virus that causes COVID-19, see How COVID-19 Spreads.

           <h3>
            Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?
           </h3>
           Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
